New slightly changed registration API. Uses .net code generator for communication proxy auto creation and dependency mapping (ioctalk codegen nuget package additional required).
This is a performance improvement by eliminate runtime code generation and no assembly type scanning anymore.
The new binary wire format and binary message serializer reduces the transfer size.

```
var localShare = new LocalShareContext();

var tcpMyService = new TcpCommunicationController(new ShortWireFraming(), new BinaryMessageSerializer());

var compositionHost = new TalkCompositionHost(localShare, "MyService");
compositionHost.RegisterAutoGeneratedProxyInterfaceMappings();

compositionHost.RegisterLocalSessionService<IMyService, MyServiceImplementation>();

compositionHost.RegisterRemoteService<IMyClientService>();
```


If you need to connect to ioctalk legacy wire format and json serialization services use:
```
new TcpCommunicationController(new LegacyWireFraming(), new JsonMessageSerializer())
```
